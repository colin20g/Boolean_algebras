# Boolean_algebras
Implementation of boolean algebras in COQ.
This software compiles (at least) with COQ 8.9.
We define boolean algebras and complete boolean algebras with the implication operator as
the sole logical connector, as long with the falsum constant. Basic properties are shown
We also build a complete boolean algebra from any paryially preordered class (and when the latter is 
itelf a boolean algebra, it is a sub algebra of the former).
